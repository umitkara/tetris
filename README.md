# Tetris Game

![Screenshot](ss.png)

My implementation of the classic game of Tetris on Python with Pygame. It needs to be multiple keypresses to move the block, i need a way to make the block move while the user is holding the key.
Animation, level, speed, pause and restart added.
Rotation needs refactoring, it is not working properly for now.
